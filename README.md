<h1>Hello People!</h1>

I'm jose calles, from venezuela, and i'm studying computer science to get inside the IT tecnologies like react, javacript, python to create really great things in the future. I have about two years making things, the problem is that i didn't save any of these proyects but i'm going to save it from now.

# What do i did?

1. design eCommerce pages
2. Weather apps, working with APIS
3. Stock administrator
4. Login and Landing Pages
5. Student Dining Room Admin Dashboard

And other ones that aren't so relevant, all of this were maked with vanilla, and some libraries like bootstrap. Anything very surprising to be honest, i'm going to start to learn some better tecnologies to create some things most interesting, but at this point, i don't have any ideas that can make me move.

## What you can do that i would like?

Maybe give me some ideas to create some things, i don't care what kind of tecnology is, even if it's in another lenguaje, if you like a lot and really have potential to use in other people, i don't even ask to. And if you're doing some things that you need to some extra help, don't worry to send me a proyect, i'll make the way to help you in some way

### Thanks to read!
